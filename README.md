PLEASE READ .env FILE and put your OWN CREDENTIALS IN THERE

GENERAL NOTES:

hello and thank you for the patiences.

there's couple of things that i would like to mention,

i didn't make up using or managing my time to create a API documentations like swagger, or markdown.
but i do usually plays around in Postman, so instead of swaggers and friend, i will give you the postman.json file for your end to test it out via Postman. I do also put Documentation inside of the each API i built in there, please navigate to Documentation menu on the API request tab (it's on top right of the screen, below ENVIRONMENT menu).

---

i do also usually uses Nest.js as backend, but here i am trying use basic of the basic using Express.js with my own project structures.



STEP to USE:

1. clone this repository
2. head to cmd, please run npm install
3. run npm run migrate
4. run npm run seeder
5. and run npm run dev to serve the application (http://localhost:3000/api/v1)


USER SAMPLE after seeding

username: sampleuser1
password: sampleuser1password


this application is pretty straight forward, it only contains couple of Schemas which i would believe it already hits the requirements that needed to achieve. although in FRONTEND i didn't managed to create page for ORDER SUMMARY right after user checkout their books. sorry for that

i've tried several test cases on my own, to ensure app is running fine as per requirements. all seems fine, but if in any case i do really open for an discussion about this project.

i am also willing to use docker at the first, but i didn't think i would make it in time for 2 DAYS, since the employer asked to be finished in 2 days. so i try my best on 2 days
